# AltairZ80

Altair Emulator For Z80

This is work in progress 8080 emulator on Z80 CPU. Based on [Terry Stewart's](https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/blog/2012-10-17-altair-emulator.htm) work.

## Changes

- Faster Instruction Dispatcher based on technique of [Simon Owen](https://simonowen.com/sam/apple1emu/) Apple 1 Emulator
- Faster instruction emulator by using alternate registers (in progress, seems to be better for now)
